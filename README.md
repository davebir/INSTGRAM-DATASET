This was the capstone project for a MYSQL Bootcamp I completed March 3, 2023

The data was a synthetic dataset my instructor created and then asked questions for us to solve

We were graded with a pass / fail for how we did on our capstone.

It was great to use SQL to clean and query this data to answer specific questions

1. QUESTION: Find the 5 oldest users on Instagram 👨🏼‍🦳
2. QUESTION: What day of the week do most users register on? 📱
3. QUESTION: We want to target our inactive users with an email campaign -> Find the users who have never posted a photo before 🤳
4. QUESTION: We're running a contest to see who can get the most likes on a single photo -> Who won? 🏆
5. QUESTION: How many times does the average user post? 🤳
