This was the capstone project for a MYSQL Bootcamp I completed March 3, 2023

The data was a synthetic dataset my instructor created and then asked questions for us to solve

We were graded with a pass / fail for how we did on our capstone.

It was great to use SQL to clean and query this data to answer specific questions
